# Neural Network From Scratch

In this repository i'm following the coding steps of sentdex's youtube series called [Neural Networks from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3)

He implements it using python, and I'm coding it in fortran 95+ (i'm a Physicist), and C (I like simple languages that have a small vocabulary). I will try to write everything as neat as possible, and use all the features of the langauge if needed. So our code syntax will diverge when he uses numpy or uses operations in such a way that is not efficient in my language.

If you want to contribute and add your own programming language, feel free to fork this repository :D (Nevermind, fork [Sentdex](https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX)'s repository and contribute there)

I hope you always have a great day
